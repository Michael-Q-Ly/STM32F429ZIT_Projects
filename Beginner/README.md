Very simple projects that increase in difficulty. These are projects I attempted by myself from a Udemy course,
which used the Bluepill MCU instead of a Discovery1 board such as mine. This helped me cross-reference
and learn how to go through reference and data sheets.

Projects here range from the simplest program all the way to structured C using bit fields and masks. I tried to
do all the code from scratch and not use any templates so that I was in full control over each program and so
that I could actually learn bare-metal C.
